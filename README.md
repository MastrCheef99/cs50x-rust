# cs50x-rust
I like low level languages, and i didn't finish cs50x last year due to starting late and procrastination. This year, I want to learn rust. Instead of just pasting old code for a lot of psets, I would prefer to also rewrite everything in rust.

Edit: Ok so i found out that rust strings are completely unbearable to use and rust is just annoying for most things, especially in cs50. I'm switching to c++ for the time being.
